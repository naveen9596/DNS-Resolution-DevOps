**Conditional DNS Forwarding** is a feature used in network environments to forward DNS queries for specific domains to designated DNS servers. It allows an organization to resolve domain names for internal or external resources by directing queries for particular domains to a different set of DNS servers, based on the domain name being queried.

### Key Points:
- **Conditional**: Only forwards DNS requests if the queried domain matches the specified condition (e.g., domain name).
- **DNS Forwarding**: Directs DNS queries to a specific DNS server instead of resolving them locally or using the default DNS servers.
  
### Use Cases:
1. **Internal Networks**: For example, in a company with multiple internal domains (e.g., `internal.company.com` and `external.partner.com`), DNS queries for `internal.company.com` could be forwarded to an internal DNS server, while queries for other domains are forwarded to the public internet or other external DNS servers.
2. **Multi-site Organizations**: In organizations with multiple sites, each site may have its own DNS server responsible for certain domains. Conditional DNS forwarding helps in resolving those domain names properly by forwarding the relevant queries to the corresponding siteâ€™s DNS server.
3. **Hybrid Cloud Environments**: Companies using both on-premises and cloud-based infrastructure can use conditional DNS forwarding to ensure DNS queries for cloud services are forwarded to the cloud DNS servers, while on-premises queries are handled locally.

### Example:
- A query for `service.internal.com` is forwarded to the internal DNS server at `192.168.1.1`.
- A query for `external.com` is forwarded to the public DNS server or left to resolve normally.

In Microsoft Active Directory environments, conditional forwarding can be set up in the DNS manager, where administrators can define specific domains and their corresponding DNS servers.
